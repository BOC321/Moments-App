?? 1. User goals
Users will:
* Open the app when they feel mentally stuck

Each button links to a unique Momentum Moment session.

? B. Session screen (Momentum Moment flow)
Each Momentum Moment includes:
1. Intro framing
* ~30-second text (optional audio later)

Optional: Users can tap “Next” to move between prompts or stay timed.

?? First: What’s the purpose of this app?
* Not to give advice
* Not to solve problems
* Not to simulate a conversation
It’s to:
? Create space
? Provide structure
? Prompt clarity
? Help people re-engage their own thinking

?? Option 1: Library-based model
(Static prompts curated and organised into categories)
? Pros:
* You stay in control of quality, tone and depth
* Strong alignment with your IP (e.g. The Moment Method)
* Scalable without introducing risk of off-brand responses
* Predictable emotional tone (no surprise outputs or awkward wording)
* Easier to build, test and refine
* Feels intentional and crafted, not random

?? What would Kate’s audience value?
Given your audience:
* High-performing, often overloaded
* Already sceptical of quick fixes or vague content
* Trust you for clarity, calm and cognitive credibility
They’re likely to respond better to:
? Beautifully crafted questions delivered with intention—not AI improvisation.

?? Strategic recommendation
? Start with a library model.
Let you and your method be the guide.
The experience should feel:
* Trusted
* Crafted
* Quiet
* Valuable by design
You can always introduce AI later as a “smart guide” feature—for example:
* A “personal clarity concierge” that recommends the next best Moment
* A prompt builder for advanced users (“Customise your own session”)
* A summariser that reflects back key patterns in their entries
But that should come after you've established the core experience, tone, and user habits.

?? Your brand power is not that it’s tech-enabled.
It’s that it enables the human brain to function better in a complex world.
AI could become part of the infrastructure.
But you are the author of the Moment. And that’s the power of this app

Developer brief: “Thinking Tracker” feature (like a cognitive Fitbit)

 Feature purpose

To help users build a visible, motivating habit of deliberate thinking — not by tracking streaks or gamifying behaviour, but by acknowledging and accumulating time spent in intentional reflection. This aligns with The Answer Trap ethos: reclaiming your mind, one small moment at a time.

 Key Components

1. Goal Setting (Optional)

Users can set a personal target (e.g. “30 minutes of thinking this week”)

Selectable options: daily, weekly, or monthly

Default could be: “No goal set yet – start tracking time when ready”


2. Session Time Logging

Each session logs the total reflection time:

Default = 10 min (3 prompts × ~3 min each)

OR actual time if timer/tracker is used
Take out the current timer in the Prompts


Add a setting toggle: “Log full session time” vs “Track actual time spent on each prompt”


3. Visual Dashboard

Display total time spent:

Today

This week

This month

All time


Could be a clean horizontal bar (like progress toward daily goal)

Optional: Add icons like a thinking bubble or brain spark


4. “Thinking Milestones”

Optional, light acknowledgment (not gamified badges):

“You’ve crossed 60 minutes of deliberate thinking!”

“5 days of clarity”

“You’ve paused to think 10 times this month”


Phrased in your tone: affirming, not performative


5. Settings & Privacy

All tracking is local (or tied to a private profile if logged in)

Option to delete, reset, or export data

Settings toggle: “Track time” on/off



---

Tone of voice for messaging

Keep it warm, quiet, and agency-affirming. Examples:

“You’ve created 12 minutes of space to think today.”

“Clarity doesn’t need hours — 3 minutes counts.”

“You’ve paused 5 times this week. That’s leadership.”



Heatmap or calendar view: “Which days did I create space to think?”

Personal insights: “You reflect most on Fridays” or “You’ve explored Mental Fog most this month”

Integration with other features: “This Stuck Point contributed 42 mins of thinking this month”
